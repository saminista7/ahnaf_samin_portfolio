Bangla NLP is personally meaningful for me because language is not just text.  
It carries culture, sarcasm, emotion, and context that generic pipelines often miss.

In my research work, I focused on emoji-aware and context-aware understanding for Bangla social media language.  
The goal is to build systems that are not only technically strong but also linguistically aware.

I believe multilingual AI progress should include practical, low-resource language innovation.
