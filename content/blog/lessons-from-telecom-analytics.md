Working with telecom datasets changes how you think about analytics engineering.

### Three lessons I apply everywhere

- **Data quality is product quality.** If inputs are messy, your model and dashboards become noise.
- **Automation compounds value.** Replacing repetitive reporting creates long-term leverage.
- **Communication is technical work.** Insights must be translated for engineers and business stakeholders.

Large-scale systems reward consistency, documentation, and clear ownership.
