Most clients do not need "more AI". They need **better outcomes**: less manual work, more reliable decisions, and faster execution.

My framework is simple:

1. Define the decision or workflow we want to improve.
2. Quantify what "better" means (speed, cost, quality, accuracy).
3. Build the lightest model/system that meets that target.
4. Integrate it into real user flow and monitor performance continuously.

When we start from business outcomes, model choices become easier and implementation becomes faster.
